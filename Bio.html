      Hi! My name is Colt. I moved to Denver in August 2019 to begin a full-stack developer
      bootcamp. The bootcamp - Skill Distillery - is largely focused on java, which will serve as the
      foundation for my Object Oriented Programming learning. During the bootcamp, I will be exposed to Java, AWS,
      JavaScript, Angular, MySQL, Spring Boot, Git, Linux, and many other invaluable tools.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>My background: </b>I have a Bachelor's of Science from the Univeristy of Oklahoma College of Architecture.
      I served in the Marine Corps for five years as a geospatial intelligence analyst. I have a passion
      for technology, structured problem solving, and design with intent; three things that I think have driven me to learn software development.
      Over the course of of 16-weeks, I will be sharing my experience as I throw myself into a promising and exciting industry.
         <br>

      The first week at Skill Distillery did not disappoint. We began by recapping content
      from the pre-work, familiarizing ourselves with Eclipse, and building simple projects
      e.g., a simple calculator.
      <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
      The day starts promptly at 8:30 a.m. and we can expect to have a pair programming project
      assigned each day around 5:00 p.m. We can also expect a project to be assigned each Friday
      evening, and due the following Monday morning.
      <br>
      <br>
      On day four, we were tasked with the well-known programming challenges FizzBuzz and Fibonacci.
      The latter proved to be a logical challenge and valuable learning experience.  Our weekend
      project was to design a program that sums an amount of money entered by the user, ask for a
      tendered amount, and then dispense the correct amount of change starting with the largest bills first.
      I found this project exciting. It allowed me to gain a better understanding of passing arguments
      to methods (and as we learned, by value, of course), using printf, hexadecimals, and conditional statements.

      My name is Colt. I am 28 years old and from Norman, Oklahoma. <br>
      I am pretty new to anything coding-related. <br> I dabbled with HTML and CSS in high school,
      but that <br>was well over a decade back (thanks, MySpace).
      <br> <br>
      I joined the Marine Corps out of high school and served as <br>a Intelligence Analyst for five years before
      making my way back home <br>to Oklahoma to begin college.
      <br> <br>
      I graduated in 2018 with Bachelor of Science from the University of <br> Oklahoma's College of Architecture.
      <br> <br>
      I am incredibly eager to begin this course - a journey I am confident will be <br>filled with struggles, and yet,
      many triumphs. I have many outdoor hobbies <br>- hiking, camping, cycling - and so I am super stoked to be here in Denver.
